I am indeed happy to associate myself in this great celebration of Humanity. I have highest respect for Dr B.R. Ambedkar who was known as the architect of Indian Constitution.

The role of Ambedkar in the struggle for social justice is tremendous. He was the first Indian to encourage the education of women and upliftment of the oppressed classes. He fought against the caste discrimination and stood for equality and human rights. Ambedkar firmly believed that liberty, equality and fraternity were the pillars of democracy.

He worked for the eradication of untouchability and strongly opposed the caste system. His efforts in the upliftment of the backward classes and women empowerment are remarkable. His ideas are inspirational for young minds.

Ambedkar once said that ‘cultivation of mind should be the ultimate aim of human existence.’ This thought resonates deeply with the belief that education is the foundation of progress. We must follow his teaching to ensure equality in our society.

He emphasised that social justice can be achieved only when every individual gets equal opportunity to grow. He believed that democracy is not just a form of government but a way of life that nurtures equality and dignity.

On this day, let us pledge to follow Ambedkar’s path and work towards building a society that is just, equal and humane for all citizens. His legacy shall inspire generations forever.
