Dr. B. R. Ambedkar was a visionary leader who believed that real freedom could be achieved only when social and economic inequalities were removed from society. He spent his entire life advocating for the rights of the oppressed and working towards a more just and equal nation.

Ambedkar criticised the caste system because it denied people their basic human rights. He argued that caste was not only a division of labour but a division of labourers, which prevented social mobility and encouraged discrimination. He believed that caste destroyed the unity of society and must be abolished.

Education was central to Ambedkar’s mission. He believed that knowledge empowers people to question oppression and fight for justice. He encouraged everyone—especially the oppressed classes—to seek education and build a better future.

Ambedkar also introduced several reforms to uplift the backward and marginalised communities. He fought for equal rights, representation, and opportunities for all citizens. His contributions to the Indian Constitution ensured that every individual is treated with dignity and equality.

Ambedkar believed that progress requires courage—the courage to stand against injustice, to challenge blind faith, and to embrace rational thinking. He urged people to break free from outdated traditions and move towards a society based on equality and fraternity.

His legacy continues to inspire millions to stand for justice, equality, and human dignity.
